Project Presentation Scenario
The student shows an up to 5-minute presentation. The students should be able to voice the technology stack they used and name the features. Then the student presents the project itself. They quickly show the user registration and login feature and the working project functionality. The teacher may ask the student to show specific pages mentioned in the menu, show how the site looks on mobile devices using the Chrome web tools feature.
Note: These requirements are subject to change based on the needs of the project and the course instructor’s guidance. It is important to maintain regular communication with the course instructor and peers to ensure the project is on track and meets the course objectives."
